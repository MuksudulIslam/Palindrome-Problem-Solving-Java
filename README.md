## Palindrome Checker Problem Solving in Java
### A Java program that takes a string as input and checks whether it is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.

#### For example:
- "level" is a palindrome.
- "java" is not a palindrome.

### This program should take a string as input, perform the palindrome check, and print a message indicating whether the input string is a palindrome or not.
